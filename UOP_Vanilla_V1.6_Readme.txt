NOTES:

I wanted to make this a new, from the ground up build.  I tried to get all files/patches/changes from the original sources. If I couldn't find an original, I used the files from the UOP Vanilla v1.5 unzip.  I also included a bunch of the readme files, etc. from the patches/mods.  See the Vanilla 1.6 Build Log.txt for more info.

Moo3Patcher.exe v0.52 needs MCF71.dll to run.  Most computers should have this; it comes with Internet Explorer 7.  Some people say it's also part of Microsoft's .Net framework - this I don't know.  You can also get it from a download site (just watch out for viruses).

The history and population Y-scalers were removed beause I haven't played enough to see how the graphs react in late game.  Right now I don't feel that I need them.  This may change as I play more...

The speederpatch changes a built in 50ms wait in the Moo3.exe to 1ms.  The 50ms is there so Moo3 doesn't hog the CPU and could adversely effect other programs running in the background.  I left the speederpatch out.

I just plain didn't like the rotate new design patch.

After researching the budget cap patch I decided not to use it.  After all, deficit spending is part of being a government isn't it?

In Vanilla v1.5 RadioShowTags.txt unzipped into the wStrings folder.  In stock Moo3 it unzips from Spreadsheets.mob so I moved it.  I also added the wsRadioShow.txt from Gerra's Cheese Mod to wStrings folder just in case there are changes there also.  I did see one difference between this file and the file taken from wStrings.mob.  I think it was a typo - there may be more, I didn't look too close...

No CD .exe because I'm tired of my CD drive spinning. I also don't use the game music.  If you want to add the music see INSTALLATION: step 4).

I fixed racemodifiers.txt; RacePickPoints table because it was broken.  Now if you want to add race pick points they go to the proper race.

Thanks,
